This is a puzzle game somewhat reminiscent of Nurikabe. The game displays a rectangular grid, some of whose cells contain numbers.
The object is to cover all of the numbers with non-overlapping rectangles so that each rectangle covers exactly one number. The number
must be the area of the rectangle that covers it.
